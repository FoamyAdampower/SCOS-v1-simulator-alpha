This is the  simulator for the OS so it can later
be later implemented in the actuall OS.

-------------------------------------------------
This version is super buggy, the code of the sim-
ulator  will use the  Microsoft Windows method of
displaying  colored text. Compiling  with TCC  is
recommended.
